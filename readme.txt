This plugin manages a whitelist of users in blogs with moderated comments. 

== Description ==

We have a WordPress built-in blacklist to moderate or mark as spam comments containing any of the words introduced.

Now we have the option to moderate our blog and enable some users, whitelisted users, to have their comments appear without moderation.

The system checks the user's email address to approve the comment.

See the [Comment Whitelist](http://taller.pequelia.es/plugins/comment-whitelist/) for further information.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin directory to your "plugins", or "mu-plugins", directory.

2. Activate the plugin, if you've installed it in the "mu-plugins" it's not necessary.

3. Now go to Settings->Discussion and put your whitelist mail accounts. You have the option to whitelist a user from the Edit Comments section.

4. This system works automatically, so there is no need to intervene.

== Updates ==

Plugin updates will be posted here [Taller de Pequelia](http://taller.pequelia.es/plugins/comment-whitelist/) and it will always link to the newest version.
